# Flutter_Movies

#Demo

#Description:
For this project I design and code a new Flutter app that displays information
about popular movies by genre. The appâ€™s first screen displays 5, horizontally
scrolling, lists. Each list contains items with information about different movies.

Each list item responds to both short and long clicks. A short click brings up a new
screen (page) that shows the entire picture of the selected movie on the entire device
display. The user can return to the list screen by selecting the back soft button in the
toolbar. If, instead, a user clicks anywhere on the displayed picture, it will open a IMDb
webisite with information about the movie

A long click on a list item brings up a pop-up menu showing the following four options
for the list item under consideration:
(a) Display a third screen with the names of the movie director, the movie stars, the
duration of the movie and two different ratings of the movie.
(b) Go to the wikipedia page for the movie.
(c) Go to the IMDb web page for the movie; this is similar to a short click on the
displayed picture 

To do:
 Fix open tabs( rn open two tabs for wiki page and IMDb)
 Further design Movie Overview page.
